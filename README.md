Implementations of use data structures for creating plausible Actors

- Behaviour Trees
  - Untested, but compiles and should work? :P
- Finite State Machines
  - Two versions - one uses states derived from enums and the other has a class that you should derive from.. the class-based one is much better for complex behaviours.
